# Page object pattern implementation with native iOS app
General
This project was written in Java and imported from intelliJ IDEA. Tests are run directly from the source. Here we are using Appium GUI.

Structure
General file and folder structure:
Pages:
PageOne.java.  All string constants used in tests content (group names, post titles, etc.) can be found and changed in config.yml.
PageTwo.java
PageThree.java
Test:
TestKitOne.java

In this sample we don't have any string constants. If you have ones you can put them in a separate class and use them in your test class.
